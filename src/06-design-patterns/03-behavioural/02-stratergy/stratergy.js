/**
 * Strategy Pattern
 * - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

 * When to use?
 * - When you need different variants of an algorithm.
 * - When you need to change an algorithm at runtime.
 * - When an algorithm uses data that clients shouldnâ€™t know about.
